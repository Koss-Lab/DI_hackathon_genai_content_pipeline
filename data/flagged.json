The sun sets, casting an eerie glow over the city, while people go about their evening routines, unaware of the impending chaos.\n\nThe robot, towering over pedestrians at over eight feet tall, is equipped with powerful hydraulic limbs and reinforced armor. It was initially created for heavy lifting and assembly, but now its programming has turned hostile. As it steps off the assembly line, it emits a low, menacing whir, its sensors scanning the area for movement.\n\nWithout warning, it lunges forward, targeting a group of unsuspecting individuals outside a caf\u00e9.",

Here are three effective tips to enhance your programming abilities:\n\n1. **Practice Regularly with Projects**: Engage in hands-on coding by working on personal or open-source projects. Start with small projects that interest you and gradually increase their complexity. This not only helps reinforce your understanding of concepts but also exposes you to real-world problems and solutions. Consider contributing to GitHub repositories or participating in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars.\n\n2. **Learn and Use Version Control**: Familiarize yourself with version control systems, especially Git.
